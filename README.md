# DeepClaude
Our project supports both non-streamed and streamed API responses. We provide non-streaming APIs for scenarios where a complete response is required, and streamed APIs for real-time feedback. By combining the strengths of DeepSeek R1, which excels in generating thought chains, and Claude, which is adept at providing comprehensive and highly intelligent answers, we offer a powerful and versatile solution.
This project also supports multiple tokens, edit app/tokens.json.

DeepClaude支持流式和非流式API，使用DeepSeek R1的推理过程，交给Claude-3.5-sonnect进行回答，获得最强大的智慧。
本项目还支持对claude添加多个tokens，token耗尽了就切换下一个，编辑app/tokens.json。
